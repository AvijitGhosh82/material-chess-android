Hello, I developed this as a hobby project last winter. I am open sourcing the project because I need help maintaining it and I really do not get more time out of college work for this. If anyone could be so kind as to help me maintain it'll be awesome!

Goals:

1. Move to Stockfish 6
2. Develop multiplayer using Play Games
3. Fix the bluetooth gaming functionality

Kindly send me pull requests and/or shoot a message at avijitg22@gmail.com if you are in or have improvements! Thank you.
